# Week 52: Sending the "Omnibus Law" to Congress (December 25-31, 2023)

**Context:** After the massive deregulation via decree (DNU 70/2023), the government sought to consolidate its structural reform agenda through the legislative branch. To do this, it introduced a monumental bill, which quickly became known as the "Omnibus Law" due to its vastness and the number of topics it covered.

---

### Key Action

*   **Introduction of the "Bases and Starting Points for the Freedom of Argentines" Bill (12/27):**
    *   **What:** The Executive Branch sent a 664-article bill to the National Congress. The goal was to obtain from the Legislature a declaration of public emergency in 11 areas and the delegation of broad legislative powers to the President for a period of two years, renewable for another two.
    *   **Motivation:** To carry out deep and rapid reforms that, by their nature, could not be implemented by decree alone. The delegation of legislative powers would allow the Executive to act more swiftly, bypassing the need to approve each change individually in Congress, where the government is a minority.

### Key Pillars of the "Omnibus Law" (Original Version)

1.  **Emergency and Delegation of Powers:**
    *   **Action:** Declared a public emergency in economic, financial, fiscal, social security, security, defense, tariff, energy, health, administrative, and social matters until December 31, 2025.
    *   **Explanation:** This was the cornerstone of the bill, granting the President extraordinary powers to legislate on vast areas of public administration.

2.  **State Reform and Privatizations:**
    *   **Action:** Listed more than 40 state-owned companies to be privatized, including Banco Nación, YPF (partially), and Aerolíneas Argentinas.
    *   **Explanation:** To reduce the size of the state, cut the fiscal deficit, and transfer the management of companies considered inefficient by the government to the private sector.

3.  **Fiscal Reform:**
    *   **Action:** Proposed a new asset regularization regime (tax amnesty), changes to the income tax (reversing a previous reform), and increases in export taxes (retenciones).
    *   **Explanation:** To increase revenue to strengthen the fiscal result, one of the pillars of the stabilization plan.

4.  **Pension Reform:**
    *   **Action:** Suspended the mobility formula that updated pensions, allowing increases to be determined by Executive decree.
    *   **Explanation:** To contain the growth of pension spending, one of the largest components of the budget, giving the government discretionary control over adjustments.

5.  **Political and Security Reforms:**
    *   **Action:** Included changes to the financing of political parties, the electoral system, and tougher penalties for protesters who block streets (criminalization of protest).
    *   **Explanation:** To change the rules of the political game and strengthen the state's ability to maintain public order in the face of protests against the adjustment measures.
