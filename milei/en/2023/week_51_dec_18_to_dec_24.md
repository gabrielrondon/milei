# Week 51: The "Megadecree" of Deregulation (December 18-24, 2023)

**Context:** Following the currency shock and the announcement of fiscal adjustments, the government deepened its deregulation strategy by publishing a far-reaching Decree of Necessity and Urgency (DNU) aimed at amending hundreds of laws to liberalize the economy.

---

### Key Action

*   **Publication of DNU 70/2023 (12/20):**
    *   **What:** President Javier Milei announced on national television the publication of Decree of Necessity and Urgency 70/2023, titled "Bases for the Reconstruction of the Argentine Economy." With 366 articles, the decree modifies or repeals a vast set of laws and regulations.
    *   **Motivation:** To remove what the government considers to be state-imposed obstacles to economic development by deregulating markets and reducing state intervention to foster free competition and private enterprise. A DNU allows for the immediate implementation of these changes, although it requires subsequent validation by Congress to become permanent.

### Key Points of DNU 70/2023

1.  **Repeal of the Rental Law:**
    *   **Action:** Eliminates the law that regulated rental contracts, allowing parties to freely agree on terms such as duration, currency (permitting contracts in US dollars), and adjustment formulas.
    *   **Explanation:** To increase the supply of rental properties, which, according to the government, had drastically decreased due to excessive regulation.

2.  **Labor Reform:**
    *   **Action:** Modifies labor legislation to, among other things, extend the probationary period, facilitate dismissals, and limit the right to strike in essential services.
    *   **Explanation:** To reduce hiring costs and the "lawsuit industry" to encourage the creation of formal jobs. *(Note: This chapter was later suspended by the Labor Courts)*.

3.  **Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises:**
    *   **Action:** Transforms all state-owned enterprises into public limited companies, a necessary legal step to enable their privatization.
    *   **Explanation:** To reduce the deficit generated by public companies and introduce private management, which is considered more efficient.

4.  **Deregulation of Healthcare:**
    *   **Action:** Allows private health insurance companies (prepagas) to set their prices without state control and modifies the system of contributions.
    *   **Explanation:** To foster competition and allow companies to adjust their prices according to their costs, eliminating state intervention in price setting.

5.  **Liberalization of Commerce:**
    *   **Action:** Repeals laws such as the Gondolas Law (which required a diversity of brands on shelves), the Price Observatory, and the Buy National Law (which gave preference to local suppliers in government procurement).
    *   **Explanation:** To eliminate price controls and protectionist barriers, relying on free competition to regulate the market.

6.  **Other Deregulations:**
    *   **Action:** Opens the market for satellite internet services (facilitating the entry of Starlink), deregulates the tourism sector, and the airline market.
    *   **Explanation:** To increase competition and the supply of services in multiple sectors.
