### Key Actions

*   **Approval of the New "Bases Law" in the Chamber of Deputies (04/30):**
    *   **What:** After intense negotiations and modifications, the Chamber of Deputies approved the new "Bases Law" (now with about 230 articles) and the fiscal package. The approval was considered a political victory for the government, which secured the necessary support from the "dialoguist" opposition.
    *   **Motivation:** The government needed a legislative tool to advance its structural reforms, such as privatizations and delegation of powers, and to consolidate fiscal adjustment. Approval in the Chamber was a fundamental step for this.

*   **Continued Social Tension:**
    *   **What:** Despite the legislative victory, social tension persisted. The effects of fiscal adjustment, such as declining consumption and increasing poverty, continued to generate concern. Demonstrations and protests, although smaller than the university march, occurred in various cities.
    *   **Impact:** The law's approval did not diminish social unrest, and the government continued to face the challenge of managing the consequences of its austerity policies on people's lives.

### Other Relevant Events

    *   **What:** The government continued conversations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about the economic program and the possibility of a new agreement or fund disbursement.
    *   **Explanation:** The IMF's support is crucial for the government's stabilization strategy, which seeks to strengthen its reserves and ensure external financing.
