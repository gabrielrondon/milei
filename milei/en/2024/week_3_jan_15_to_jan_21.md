# Week 3: Concessions on the "Omnibus Law" and a Judicial Setback (January 15-21, 2024)

**Context:** The pressure mounts on the government to get the "Omnibus Law" approved in the congressional committees. To achieve this, the negotiating team concedes on crucial points of the original bill, seeking an agreement with the "dialoguist" opposition. Meanwhile, the Judiciary reaffirms its decision to halt the labor reform via DNU.

### Key Actions

*   **Modifications to the "Omnibus Law" to Gain Support:**
    *   **What:** After intense negotiations, the government agreed to make significant changes to the text of the law to ensure its approval in the committees (the so-called "dictamen de mayoría").
    *   **Motivation:** Lacking the necessary votes to pass the original version, the government was forced to yield to avoid a total defeat. The strategy shifted to approving a core set of reforms, even if less ambitious than the initial proposal.

*   **Main Concessions Made:**
    1.  **Privatizations:** The oil company YPF was removed from the list of companies to be privatized. The privatization of Banco Nación and Arsat was also limited, requiring a specific legislative process.
    2.  **Export Taxes (Retenciones):** The government eliminated the tax increase for regional economies, a key demand from governors and their deputies.
    3.  **Pension Formula:** The proposal to suspend the pension adjustment formula and grant increases by decree was withdrawn. Instead, the government proposed to keep the current formula until March and then create a new update mechanism tied to inflation.
    4.  **Delegation of Powers:** The term of the public emergency and the delegation of powers to the president was reduced from four years (two, renewable for another two) to just one year, with the possibility of a one-year extension by Congress.

*   **Confirmation of the Suspension of the Labor Reform:**
    *   **What:** The National Chamber of Labor Appeals rejected the government's appeal and ratified the precautionary measure that suspended the application of the labor chapter of DNU 70/2023.
    *   **Impact:** This consolidated the judicial setback for the government, making it clear that the labor reform, one of the central pieces of the deregulation plan, would necessarily have to go through debate and approval in Congress.
