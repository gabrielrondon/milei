# Week 4: The General Strike and Committee Approval (January 22-28, 2024)

**Context:** Social and political tension peaks with the first general strike against the Milei government. In Congress, after the previous week's concessions, the government finally secures the necessary support for the "Omnibus Law" to advance to the next stage: the debate on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies.

### Key Actions

*   **First General Strike against the Government (01/24):**
    *   **What:** The CGT, along with other trade unions and social organizations, held a 12-hour general strike that culminated in a large demonstration in front of the National Congress. It was the fastest general strike ever called against a newly inaugurated government in Argentine history.
    *   **Motivation:** To protest massively against DNU 70/2023 and the "Omnibus Law" bill, which were considered a threat to labor rights, national sovereignty (due to privatizations), and the purchasing power of the population.
    *   **Government's Response:** The government downplayed the strike's impact, stating it was a measure by "mafia-like unionists" who oppose change. The Minister of Security, Patricia Bullrich, implemented a strong security operation to prevent street blockades, known as the "anti-picket protocol."

*   **Obtaining Majority Opinion for the "Omnibus Law" (01/24):**
    *   **What:** On the same day as the general strike, the government managed, after lengthy negotiations, to obtain the "dictamen de mayoría" (majority opinion) in the plenary of committees of the Chamber of Deputies. The text, already with modifications, got the necessary signatures to be debated on the floor.
    *   **Motivation:** It was a crucial step and a political victory for the government, as it meant the project had not been defeated in the committees and would now be debated by the full Chamber. The support was secured from the "dialoguist" opposition (UCR, Hacemos Coalición Federal, etc.), albeit with many reservations and partial dissenting signatures.

### Other Relevant Events

*   **Tension with Governors:**
    *   **What:** The Minister of Economy, Luis Caputo, publicly threatened to cut fund transfers to the provinces even further if the "Omnibus Law" was not approved in Congress. The statement generated a strong reaction from governors, including allies.
    *   **Explanation:** The statement exposed the national government's fiscal pressure strategy on the provinces to align their deputies and senators, increasing tension in the already complex federal relationship.
