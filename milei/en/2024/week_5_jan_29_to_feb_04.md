# Week 5: The "In General" Approval and the Beginning of the End (January 29 to February 04, 2024)

**Context:** This is the decisive week for the future of the "Omnibus Law." After obtaining the committee's opinion, the bill reaches the floor of the Chamber of Deputies for a session that would last for several days, marked by intense debates, demonstrations outside, and a bittersweet result for the government.

### Key Actions

*   **Marathon Session in the Chamber of Deputies (01/31 to 02/02):**
    *   **What:** The Chamber of Deputies began the debate on the "Omnibus Law" in a session that lasted almost three consecutive days. While the deputies debated, thousands of protesters demonstrated outside Congress, with some clashes with security forces enforcing the "anti-picket protocol."
    *   **Motivation:** The government needed to demonstrate political strength and get the law passed to validate its reform strategy. The opposition, in turn, used the long session to expose all its criticisms of the project.

*   **"In General" Approval of the Law (02/02):**
    *   **What:** On Friday, February 2, the Chamber of Deputies finally voted and approved the law "in general" by 144 votes in favor to 109 against. This meant that the general concept of the bill and the declaration of emergencies were approved.
    *   **Impact:** The government celebrated the result as a historic victory. However, the approval in general was only the first step. The hardest part was yet to come: the vote on each of the more than 300 articles (after modifications) and their clauses.

*   **Postponement of the Article-by-Article Vote:**
    *   **What:** After the general approval, and due to the extreme exhaustion of the legislators and the lack of agreements on the most controversial articles (privatizations, delegation of powers, taxes), the presidency of the Chamber decided to move the "in particular" (article-by-article) vote to the following week.
    *   **Explanation:** This decision would prove fatal. The postponement gave time for the government's fragile alliances to break down. It became clear that although the "dialoguist" opposition was willing to give the government some tools, it would not approve the points it considered most harmful or that directly affected the interests of their provinces.

### The Foreshadowing of Collapse

The week ended with a sense of victory for the government, but the foundations for the law's collapse had already been laid. The lack of solid agreements for the article-by-article vote and the growing mistrust between the government and its circumstantial allies created a scenario of uncertainty that would explode the following week, leading to the complete withdrawal of the project.
