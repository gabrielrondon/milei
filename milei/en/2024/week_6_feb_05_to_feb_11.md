# Week 6: The Collapse of the "Omnibus Law" (February 05-11, 2024)

**Context:** After the "in general" approval of the "Omnibus Law" the previous week, the article-by-article vote in the Chamber of Deputies proved to be a disaster for the government. The lack of agreements and the breakdown of alliances led to the complete withdrawal of the bill, marking the first major legislative setback for the Milei government.

### Key Actions

*   **Article-by-Article Vote of the "Omnibus Law" and its Failure (02/06):**
    *   **What:** The session in the Chamber of Deputies for the article-by-article vote of the "Omnibus Law" resumed. However, the government began to suffer defeats on crucial clauses, such as the delegation of powers and the privatization of state-owned companies.
    *   **Motivation:** The "dialoguist" opposition, which had supported the general approval, was unwilling to concede on points it considered essential or that affected the interests of their provinces. The lack of a solid support base and the government's intransigence on some key issues led to the breakdown of agreements.

*   **Complete Withdrawal of the Bill (02/06):**
    *   **What:** Faced with the imminent rejection of central parts of the bill, the ruling bloc (La Libertad Avanza) made the drastic decision to withdraw the bill entirely and send it back to square one, i.e., to the committees.
    *   **Impact:** This represented a significant political defeat for the Milei government. The "all or nothing" strategy proved ineffective, exposing the government's fragility in Congress, where it holds a minority. The withdrawal of the bill meant that all the hours of debate and negotiation were in vain, and the government would have to start from scratch if it wanted to pass similar reforms.

### Government's Reaction

*   **Accusations of "Treason" and "Caste":**
    *   **What:** President Milei and his ministers reacted harshly to the defeat, accusing the deputies and governors who did not support the bill of being part of the political "caste" that opposes change. The president even published a list of "traitors" on his social media.
    *   **Explanation:** The government's reaction demonstrated its frustration with the legislative setback and its polarization strategy, seeking to blame the opposition for the failure to pass the reforms.
