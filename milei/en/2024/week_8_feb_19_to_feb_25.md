### Key Actions

*   **Narrative War with Governors:**
    *   **What:** The national government, through President Milei and his ministers, continued to justify the fund cuts to the provinces as a necessary measure to achieve "zero deficit" and combat the political "caste." The governors, in turn, denounced financial strangulation and the lack of dialogue.
    *   **Motivation:** The government seeks to consolidate the support of its electoral base, presenting itself as the defender of the people's interests against a political "caste" that opposes the adjustment. The governors, on the other hand, try to defend provincial autonomy and public services affected by the cuts.

*   **Announcement of the "Pacto de Mayo" (May Pact) (02/23):**
    *   **What:** In his opening speech to the ordinary sessions of Congress, President Milei called on governors and former presidents to sign a "Pacto de Mayo" in Córdoba, with 10 fundamental principles for Argentina's future. Among them, the defense of private property, non-negotiable fiscal balance, and state reform.
    *   **Impact:** The proposal was seen as an attempt by the government to reverse the image of confrontation and seek a new political agreement after the failure of the "Omnibus Law." However, the call was made in terms that many governors considered imposing, generating skepticism.

### Other Relevant Events

*   **Debate on "Social Peace":**
    *   **What:** With the escalation of tension and fund cuts, the debate on maintaining "social peace" gained momentum. Social and political sectors expressed concern about the impact of the adjustment measures on the population and the risk of conflicts.
    *   **Explanation:** The concern reflected the increase in poverty and indigence, as well as the deterioration of the purchasing power of wages and pensions, creating an environment of growing social unrest.
