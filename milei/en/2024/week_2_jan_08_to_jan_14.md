# Week 2: Intense Debate, Negotiations, and the Inflation Data (January 08-14, 2024)

**Context:** The second week of January sees the "Omnibus Law" debate intensify in Congress, with marathon sessions. At the same time, the government begins to negotiate with the "dialoguist" opposition to ensure the law's approval, while the first official inflation data under the new administration reveals the size of the initial impact of the measures.

### Key Actions

*   **Marathon Debates on the "Omnibus Law":**
    *   **What:** The committees of the Chamber of Deputies held extensive and heated sessions, often lasting into the early hours, to debate each article of the "Bases" bill. The opposition criticized the breadth of the delegation of powers and the lack of detail in many proposals.
    *   **Motivation:** The government sought to speed up the process to obtain a committee opinion (dictamen de mayoría) as soon as possible, in order to bring the law to a vote on the floor.

*   **Start of Negotiations with the Opposition:**
    *   **What:** Faced with the difficulty of obtaining the necessary votes, the government began negotiations with governors and deputies from more moderate blocs (such as the UCR and Hacemos Coalición Federal). The government began to signal flexibility on sensitive points, such as the level of export taxes (retenciones) for regional economies and the list of companies to be privatized.
    *   **Motivation:** A pragmatic recognition that, with its legislative minority, the "all or nothing" strategy would not work. Negotiation became essential to avoid a complete defeat of the project.

*   **Call for a General Strike (01/09):**
    *   **What:** The CGT (General Confederation of Labor) officially announced a national general strike with mobilization for January 24.
    *   **Motivation:** To protest against DNU 70/2023 and the "Omnibus Law," which, according to the unions, represented an unprecedented attack on workers' rights, the union model, and national industry.

### Relevant Economic Data

*   **Publication of December Inflation (01/11):**
    *   **What:** INDEC (National Institute of Statistics and Censuses) published the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December 2023, which reached **25.5%**.
    *   **Impact:** It was the highest monthly inflation in over 30 years. The government argued that the figure was the inevitable consequence of the "bomb" left by the previous administration and the unwinding of repressed prices. The opposition and critics, on the other hand, pointed to the figure as a direct result of the maxidevaluation and deregulation, warning of its social impact.
