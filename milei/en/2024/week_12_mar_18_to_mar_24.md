# Week 12: Consolidation of Adjustment and New Tensions (March 18-24, 2024)

**Context:** The Milei government remains firm in its fiscal adjustment policy, with the release of data reinforcing the achievement of a primary surplus. However, new tensions arise, especially concerning social sectors and universities, while dialogue for the "Pacto de Mayo" advances slowly.

### Key Actions

*   **Confirmation of Primary Surplus:**
    *   **What:** The Ministry of Economy announced that the government achieved a primary and financial surplus in the first months of the year. This data was widely celebrated by the government as proof of the effectiveness of its austerity policy.
    *   **Motivation:** To demonstrate that the "zero deficit" plan is viable and that the adjustment is producing the expected results, seeking to strengthen investor and public confidence in economic management.

*   **New Tensions with Social and University Sectors:**
    *   **What:** Conflicts deepened with social organizations due to cuts in assistance programs and with public universities, which denounced outdated budgets and the risk of activities being paralyzed.
    *   **Impact:** Budget cuts, although essential for the adjustment, generated strong resistance in sectors that depend on state funding, increasing social pressure on the government.

### Other Relevant Events

*   **Cautious Progress of the "Pacto de Mayo":**
    *   **What:** The government continued conversations with governors and political leaders about the "Pacto de Mayo," seeking to smooth out differences and build minimal consensus. The proposal for a new, leaner "Bases Law" began to be discussed behind the scenes.
    *   **Explanation:** After the failure of the first "Omnibus Law," the government realized the need to negotiate and concede on some points to gain legislative support for its reforms.
