### Key Actions

*   **Start of the "Omnibus Law" Debate in Congress (from 01/02):**
    *   **What:** The committees of the Chamber of Deputies begin the formal debate on the "Bases" bill. Government ministers, such as Guillermo Francos (Interior) and Patricia Bullrich (Security), appear to defend the bill and answer questions from deputies.
    *   **Motivation:** To try to convince legislators of the necessity and urgency of the reforms, seeking to build a consensus for the bill's approval, which faces strong resistance from the opposition and sectors of society.

*   **Judicial Suspension of the Labor Reform (01/03):**
    *   **What:** The General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the country's main trade union confederation, obtains a precautionary measure from the Labor Court that suspends the application of the entire Chapter IV (Labor) of DNU 70/2023.
    *   **Motivation (of the Legal Action):** The unions argued that the proposed changes were unconstitutional, as they affected the acquired rights of workers and that a reform of such magnitude could not be done by a decree of necessity and urgency, but rather through a proper legislative debate.
    *   **Impact:** It was the first major judicial defeat for the DNU, casting doubt on the feasibility of applying the most controversial reforms by decree and strengthening the position of the unions, which called a general strike for the end of the month.

### Other Relevant Events

*   **First National "Cacerolazo" (Pot-Banging Protest):**
    *   **What:** In parallel with the suspension of the labor reform, spontaneous demonstrations with "cacerolazos" (pot-banging) took place in several cities across the country, protesting against the DNU and the adjustment measures.
    *   **Explanation:** It represented the first major expression of social discontent against the government, showing that opposition to the measures was not limited to unions and political parties.
