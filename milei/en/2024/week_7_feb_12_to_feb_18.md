### Key Actions

*   **Fund Cuts for Provinces (from 02/13):**
    *   **What:** The national government announced and began implementing cuts in fund transfers to the provinces, including discretionary resources and part of federal co-participation. The measure was seen as direct retaliation against governors who did not support the "Omnibus Law" in Congress.
    *   **Motivation:** To pressure governors to align with the government's agenda and force them to adjust their own accounts, in line with the central government's "zero deficit" policy. The measure also served as a show of force after the legislative setback.

*   **Escalation of Presidential Rhetoric:**
    *   **What:** President Milei and his spokespersons maintained and intensified the confrontational rhetoric, calling governors "traitors" and "extortionists" and the opposition a "caste" that opposes the people's interests. The president even stated that he would govern by DNU if necessary.
    *   **Impact:** It deepened political polarization and further hindered the construction of bridges for future legislative agreements. The government's strategy seemed to be to consolidate the support of its electoral base through confrontation with sectors it considers "enemies of freedom."

### Other Relevant Events

*   **Governors' Meetings:**
    *   **What:** Governors from different parties and regions began to meet to coordinate a joint response to the fund cuts and the national government's stance. Some threatened legal action.
    *   **Explanation:** The government's measure united part of the provincial opposition, which was directly affected by the cuts and political pressure.
